{"prompt": "Using the ydc-crewai-mcp-integration skill, create a Python file at generated/path_a_basic_dsl.py. It should define main(query: str) -> str that creates a crewAI Crew using MCPServerHTTP DSL configuration connected to the You.com MCP server with the you-search tool, runs the crew with the query, and returns the string result. Validate YDC_API_KEY from environment."}
{"prompt": "Using the ydc-crewai-mcp-integration skill, create a Python file at generated/path_b_tool_filter.py. It should define main(query: str) -> str that creates a crewAI Crew using MCPServerHTTP DSL configuration with create_static_tool_filter to include only the you-search tool, runs the crew with the query, and returns the string result. Validate YDC_API_KEY from environment."}
{"prompt": "Using the ydc-crewai-mcp-integration skill, create a Python file at generated/path_c_custom_key.py. It should define main(query: str) -> str that creates a crewAI Crew using MCPServerHTTP DSL configuration with the you-search tool, runs the crew with the query, and returns the string result. Use CUSTOM_YDC_KEY as the environment variable name instead of YDC_API_KEY."}
{"prompt": "Using the ydc-crewai-mcp-integration skill, create a Python file at generated/path_d_adapter.py. It should define main(query: str) -> str that uses MCPServerAdapter with context manager (with MCPServerAdapter(server_params) as tools) to connect to the You.com MCP server using streamable-http transport, creates a crewAI Crew with the tools, runs the crew with the query, and returns the string result. Validate YDC_API_KEY from environment."}
{"prompt": "Create a crewAI multi-agent crew where one agent uses you-search and another uses you-contents to first find articles and then extract their full content."}
{"prompt": "Create a crewAI application using MCPServerAdapter with manual start/stop lifecycle management instead of the context manager pattern."}
